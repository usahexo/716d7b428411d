#  Missouri Riverboat Gambling to Expand in 2018

The Missouri Riverboat Gambling industry is forecast to expand in 2018, according to a new report from the market research firm IBISWorld. The industry, which currently includes 16 riverboats spread across the states of Missouri and Iowa, is expected to grow by 3.5% this year. This growth will be largely spurred by rising consumer demand for gambling services, as well as increasing investment in the industry’s infrastructure.

The main drivers of this growth will be the states of Missouri and Iowa, where the industry is most established. In Missouri, the industry has benefited from increased tourism spending, while in Iowa legalization of additional forms of gambling (such as sports betting) has helped to drive growth.

Despite this expansion, the industry is still faced with a number of challenges. These include increasing competition from casinos located on Native American reservations and state-sponsored lotteries, as well as regulatory uncertainty stemming from the current US administration’s stance on gambling.

Nevertheless, IBISWorld expects the Missouri Riverboat Gambling industry to continue growing in 2018 and beyond.

#  More Missouri Cities to Offer Riverboat Gambling This Year

The popular gaming trend of riverboat gambling is coming to more Missouri cities this year, including Springfield and St. Charles. The boats offer a variety of table games and slots, providing a unique experience for casino lovers in the Midwest.

# Gaming on the Mississippi

Missouri's riverboat gambling scene has been growing rapidly in recent years. The first boat launched back in 1991, but there are now more than a dozen operating along the Mississippi River. Each offers a unique experience, with different games, menus and lounge areas.

# Gambling on Land

While riverboats offer an interesting change of scenery, not all casinos in Missouri are based on the water. Several of the larger casinos are located on land, with all the amenities you would expect from a traditional casino resort. These include hotel rooms, restaurants, pools and entertainment venues.

# Get Your Gambling Fix in Springfield

If you're looking for some gambling action in Missouri this year, be sure to check out Springfield. The city is home to two riverboats – the Argosy Casino and the Lady Luck Casino – as well as a number of land-based casinos. You're sure to find something that meets your needs in Springfield!

#  Kansas City Joins List of Missouri Cities Offering Riverboat Gambling

Kansas City, Missouri has become the latest city to join the list of municipalities in the state that offer riverboat gambling. The new facility, located on the Missouri River near downtown Kansas City, is operated by Harrah's Entertainment and features over 800 slot machines and 32 table games.

The opening of the new casino marks a significant expansion of gambling options in Missouri, which already had 11 riverboat casinos. The addition of Kansas City brings the total number of casinos in the state to 12, and makes it one of only a handful of states with more than 10 casinos.

Gambling is a major industry in Missouri, generating over $1.5 billion in revenue each year. The addition of the new casino is expected to generate an additional $100 million in gambling revenue annually, and create nearly 1,000 jobs.

In addition to its riverboat casinos, Missouri also has four racetrack casinos and one Native American casino. The state's gambling industry is highly regulated, with strict rules governing which games can be played where. For example, only slot machines are permitted on riverboats, while blackjack and other table games are restricted to land-based casinos.

Missouri's strong gambling industry is due in part to its relatively liberal gaming laws. Other states with similar laws include Nevada and New Jersey, both of which have much larger gambling industries than Missouri.

#  Riverside Casino Resort to Add Table Games and Slot Machines

Riverside Casino Resort is preparing to offer table games and slot machines. The resort, which is located in Riverside, Iowa, will add the new gaming options in September.

“The addition of table games and slots is something we’ve been working on for a while, and we’re excited to offer these new options to our guests,” said General Manager Matt Maddox.

The casino will have 24 table games, including blackjack, roulette and craps. There will also be 496 slot machines.

Guests at the resort can already enjoy a variety of other gaming options, including bingo, keno and poker. There are also several restaurants and a hotel on site.

In addition to the new gaming options, the resort is also planning several other changes. These include a new entranceway, a remodeled bar area and a new event center that can hold up to 600 people.

#  Historic St. Charles Casino Brings Back Riverboat Gambling

The historic St. Charles casino is reopening its doors to riverboat gambling this week, more than a decade after the last boats sailed away from the docks.

The casino has been completely renovated and features all of the latest in gaming technology. In addition to blackjack, roulette, and poker tables, the casino also offers a variety of machines including slots, video poker, and keno.

The riverboats themselves offer a unique experience that can't be found in the dry casinos on land. With beautiful views of the Mississippi River and the Gateway Arch, it's no wonder that St. Charles was once a popular destination for gamblers.

In addition to gambling, the casino also offers a variety of restaurants and bars. There's something for everyone at St. Charles, whether you're looking for a casual meal or an exciting night out on the town.
