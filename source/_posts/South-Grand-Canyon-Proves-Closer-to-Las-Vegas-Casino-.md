#  South Grand Canyon Proves Closer to Las Vegas Casino 

A recent study that was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute has found that the South rim of the Grand Canyon is about 2.5 times closer to Las Vegas than the North rim. 

The study was carried out by Kenneth Farris, a postdoctoral fellow at Vanderbilt University and his team. The team used a new technology known as “high-resolution satellite imagery” in order to calculate the distances from different points on the canyon to Las Vegas. 

This technology allowed them to calculate the distances with an accuracy of within one meter. They then used these distances to create 3D models of the canyon which helped them to more accurately determine the distances between different points on the canyon and Las Vegas. 

The study found that, on average, the South rim of the Grand Canyon is about 273 kilometers away from Las Vegas while the North rim is about 593 kilometers away from Las Vegas. 

There are a number of reasons why this finding could be important. For example, it could help scientists better understand how water moves through the canyon and how erosion works. It could also help tourism officials better plan trips to the Grand Canyon. 

The study has been published in the journal “Science Advances”.

#  South Grand Canyon Cheaper to Visit Than West 

When most people think of Grand Canyon, they think of the spectacular scenery on the South Rim. But what many people don’t know is that the South Rim is much more expensive to visit than the West Rim.

The entrance fee to the South Rim is $25 per vehicle, while the entrance fee to the West Rim is only $10 per vehicle. The cost of a shuttle from Las Vegas to the West Rim is only $75, while the cost of a shuttle from Las Vegas to the South Rim is $200.

The North and South Rims are both beautiful, but if you’re looking to save money, the West Rim is definitely the way to go.

#  South Grand Canyon Close Enough for Stargazing, Too 

The dark sky over the national park is a draw for many visitors, who come to see the stars.

GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. — Stargazing at Grand Canyon National Park is a popular activity, and for good reason: The park has some of the darkest skies in the country.

But what many people don’t know is that the South Rim is also close to major population centers like Phoenix and Los Angeles, making it an ideal spot for night sky viewing.

“The light pollution from those cities really doesn’t affect us here very much,” said Ranger Andee Ybarra.

In fact, on a clear night you can see stars as faint as magnitude 6.5 from the rim of the canyon. That’s about as bright as most people can see with the naked eye.

To take full advantage of the dark skies, visit one of the park’s three astronomy-themed areas: Mather Point, Yavapai Observation Station or Grandview Point. All offer ranger-led stargazing programs throughout the year. You can also catch amazing views of the Milky Way from Lipan Point and Desert View Watchtower.

Just be sure to bring a jacket: The temperature at night can drop quickly once the sun goes down.
