#  Mariners could be 'darkhorse candidate' to make World Series run in 2017

Although they didn't make the playoffs in 2016, the Seattle Mariners are being considered a "darkhorse candidate" to make a World Series run in 2017.

Offseason moves including the acquisitions of Jarrod Dyson and Mitch Haniger have excited fans and pundits alike, with some believing that the Mariners could surprise everyone and make it all the way to the Fall Classic.

In an interview with MLB.com, Haniger said that the team is working hard in the offseason to get better:

"We're all grinding in the offseason, trying to get better...I think we have a good shot at it. We just have to come out and play our game."

While it's certainly too early to tell whether or not the Mariners will be contenders this year, there's no doubt that they have some talented players on their roster and could very well make a playoff run.

#  Seattle Mariners hoping for playoff return in 2017 

The Seattle Mariners had an up-and-down 2016 campaign, but are looking to return to the playoffs in 2017. Heading into the season, the Mariners have a solid core of players and should be contenders in the American League West.

Seattle's offense is led by Robinson Cano, who is coming off of another excellent season. Nelson Cruz also provides plenty of power from the cleanup spot, while Kyle Seager and Ketel Marte provide steady production in the middle of the lineup. The Mariners also have some talented young hitters, such as Mitch Haniger and Ben Gamel, who could make an impact this season.

In terms of pitching, Seattle has a few question marks. Felix Hernandez had a down year in 2016 and will need to bounce back if the Mariners are going to make a playoff run. James Paxton and Hisashi Iwakuma are both capable starters, while Edwin Diaz provides a dominant closer option at the back end of the bullpen. If everything comes together for Seattle's pitching staff, they could be a tough team to beat.

Overall, the Mariners appear to be a good bet to return to the playoffs in 2017. They have a well-rounded team with plenty of talent and should be competitive in one of baseball's toughest divisions.

#  MLB season predictions: Seattle Mariners will surprise many this year

The Mariners had a great offseason, picking up speedy outfielder Dee Gordon and slugger Nelson Cruz. Many experts are predicting them to finish in last place in the American League West. I believe they will finish third in the division behind the Astros and Angels.

Gordon is an excellent addition to the team. He hit .333 last year with 205 hits, 58 stolen bases, and 88 runs scored for the Marlins. He will lead off for the Mariners and get on base often for them. Cruz is another big bat that the Mariners added this offseason. He hit .288 with 40 home runs and 108 RBIs last year for the Baltimore Orioles. These two bats will help the Mariners score plenty of runs this season.

Their pitching staff is not very strong, but I think they will be good enough to get them into third place in their division. Their bullpen is led by Fernando Rodney, who had 48 saves last season with the Rays. His experience will be valuable to the Mariners in close games this season.

The Mariners are not a team that many people are talking about this preseason, but I believe they will surprise many people and finish with a winning record.

#  Why the Seattle Mariners could make a postseason push in 2017

A lot can happen in six months. The Seattle Mariners, who started the season off with a sluggish 13-17 record, have turned their season around and are now just two games out of first place in the American League West.

There are many reasons for the Mariners’ turnaround. One of the biggest has been their improved offense. In the first month of the season, the Mariners averaged just 3.5 runs per game. However, in the past month they have averaged 5.2 runs per game.

Some of the offensive improvement can be attributed to the addition of slugger Nelson Cruz, who is currently leading the American League in home runs. But other players have also stepped up their game, including Kyle Seager and Robinson Cano.

The Mariners’ pitching staff has also been impressive this season. Led by ace Felix Hernandez, they currently have the fourth best ERA in all of baseball (3.42).

So can the Mariners make a postseason push in 2017? Absolutely! They currently have one of the best records in baseball over the past month and have a good chance at winning their division.

#  Seattle Mariners primed for a big 2017

The Seattle Mariners surprised a lot of people last year, making a run at the playoffs before finishing just shy. This year, they are primed for an even better season.

The Mariners’ lineup is led by Robinson Cano, who is one of the best hitters in baseball. He will be joined in the lineup by sluggers Nelson Cruz and Kyle Seager. The Mariners also have some young talent in their lineup, including shortstop Jean Segura and outfielder Mitch Haniger.

Their pitching staff is led by ace Felix Hernandez. Hernandez is coming off a disappointing season, but he should be back to his old self this year. The Mariners also have some good young pitching prospects, including James Paxton and Edwin Diaz.

Overall, the Mariners look like a team that is ready to take the next step and make the playoffs. They will be one of the teams to watch in the American League this season.
