#  Mariners win 50 games of 250 in 2017 season!

The Mariners may have had a lackluster season, but they made it count. Winning 50 out of their 250 games played in the 2017 season, they finished just shy of an 80-win season. The young talent on the roster is sure to bring much more excitement and wins to Seattle in the years to come.

Despite Nelson Cruz’s retirement, the Mariners still boasted a powerful lineup. Mitch Haniger had a breakout rookie season, hitting .282 with 26 home runs and 93 RBI. Dee Gordon also put up great numbers in his first year in Seattle, batting .308 and stealing 45 bases. While Robinson Canó didn’t have his best year statistically speaking, he still led the team in doubles (39) and RBI (104).

The starting rotation also showed promise for the future. James Paxton emerged as the ace of the staff, going 11-6 with a 3.76 ERA. Marco Gonzales pitched well after being called up from Triple-A early on in the season, going 12-8 with a 4.00 ERA. Mike Leake was acquired at the trade deadline and pitched solidly for Seattle down the stretch, going 5-2 with a 2.53 ERA in nine starts.

 Unfortunately, Edwin Díaz was not able to replicate his MVP-caliber performance from last year. He finished with 29 saves but also blew 10 saves and posted a 4.04 ERA. Chris Herrmann was one bright spot behind the plate; he led all catchers in WAR (2.5) while posting a solid .279 batting average.

Even though they fell just short of making the playoffs, there are plenty of reasons for fans to be excited about the Mariners’ future prospects. With so many young stars on the rise, Seattle is sure to win many more games in 2018 and beyond!
