# How to play the Cod Slot Machine

1) Cut a piece of paper into three strips, each about 8 inches long and 1 inch wide.
2) Make a small hole in the center of each strip.
3) Thread a rubber band through each hole, making sure the rubber bands are even on both sides.
4) Lay one strip out flat with the holes at the top. This will be your "playing area."
5) Put two pieces of cod (or whatever you're using for coins) next to each other on the playing area, with the tails facing each other.
6) Take the second strip of paper and tie it around the first strip just above the cod, making sure it's tight. This will hold everything in place.
7) Play away!

3. The adrenaline rush you get from gambling is similar to the adrenaline rush you get from eating – both activities make your heart race and give you a burst of energy.

4. Cod is a versatile fish that can be cooked in lots of different ways, so you never get bored of it.

5. COD IS ADDICTIVE! Just like gambling, once you start eating cod regularly, you’ll find it hard to stop. You’ll develop a craving for it, and you’ll keep coming back for more.
