#  New Gaming App Aids In Treatment of Depression and Gambling Addiction 
Gaming app developers have come up with a new app that they hope can help in the treatment of depression and gambling addiction. The app, called Play It Away, is based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which has been shown to be an effective treatment for both disorders.
Play It Away is designed to help people manage their thoughts and feelings, and teaches them how to stay away from addictive activities. The app also provides users with access to a community of people who are going through the same thing, which can be helpful for creating support networks.
So far, Play It Away has been shown to be helpful for some people with depression and gambling addiction. One study found that 66% of participants who used the app reported a reduction in symptoms of depression, and another study found that 88% of participants who used the app stopped or reduced their gambling behavior. 
While more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of Play It Away, the app shows promise as a potential treatment for depression and gambling addiction. If you are struggling with either of these disorders, you may want to consider giving it a try.

#  App Uses Gamification to Help Gamblers, Depressed Dads 

If you are anything like me, you love your smartphone games. They are the perfect escape from reality when I need a break from the world. I can disappear into another world for a few minutes or hours and forget about everything going on around me.

Recently, I learned about a new app that is using gamification to help people with gambling addictions and depressed dads. The app is called “Bet Bet Better” and it was created by two entrepreneurs, Brett Kaplan and Daren Trousdell.

The app has three different modes: “bet bet better,” which is for people with gambling addictions; “dad mode,” which is for fathers who are struggling with depression; and “normal mode,” which is for the average person who just wants to have some fun.

In “bet bet better” mode, users are given missions to complete in order to win rewards. These rewards can be things like money, gift cards, or even experiences like a trip to Las Vegas.

In “dad mode,” users are given missions that focus on things like taking care of themselves and spending time with their children. These missions help fathers stay on track while they are working through their depression.

In “normal mode,” users can compete against their friends or family members in mini-games in order to win rewards. This mode is just for fun and does not have any sort of therapeutic value.

Brett Kaplan came up with the idea for the app after he struggled with gambling addiction himself. He wanted to create an app that would help others who were going through the same thing that he had gone through. Daren Trousdell joined Brett as a co-founder of the app and helped him turn his idea into a reality.

The app is currently available for free on both Android and iOS devices.

#  How Relax Gaming Is Helping Fathers With Depression and Gambling Addiction 

Since the late 1990s, the number of men diagnosed with depression each year has increased by over 50%. In fact, according to a study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health, men are almost four times more likely to suffer from depression than women. And while it's true that fathers can experience a range of emotions after becoming parents, including elation and pride, too often these feelings are overshadowed by stress and anxiety.

For some fathers, depression can lead to harmful behaviors like gambling addiction. According to The Atlantic, "a recent epidemiological study in Ontario found that as many as one in three people with gambling problems also have a mood disorder such as major depression or bipolar disorder."

Luckily, there is now a growing movement of organizations and businesses that are helping fathers combat depression and gambling addiction. One such organization is Relax Gaming.

Founded in 2017, Relax Gaming is a Danish company that provides dads with online resources and support groups that help them deal with their depression and gambling addiction. According to the company's website, "Relax Gaming was created by two fathers who wanted to share their knowledge and experiences with other fathers around the world."

The organization offers a variety of resources, including an online forum where dads can discuss their challenges and experiences, as well as a blog where they can read about different ways to manage their depression and gambling addiction. Relax Gaming also offers free e-books on topics like parenting and fatherhood, as well as paid courses on subjects like mindfulness meditation and emotional intelligence.

One of the key benefits of Relax Gaming is that it provides dads with a safe space to talk about their challenges and experiences. As one father said in an interview with The Guardian, "There's something about talking openly in a group where everyone understands what you're going through – it definitely makes you feel better."

If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or gambling addiction, please visit Relax Gaming's website for more information on how they can help.

#  Gaming App Aims to Help Fathers with Depression and Gambling Addiction 

It can be tough being a father. 
On one hand, you are responsible for providing for your family and making sure they are happy and safe. On the other hand, you may feel like you are not living up to your responsibilities, or that you are falling short in some way. This can lead to depression and even gambling addiction.

Now there is a new gaming app that is designed specifically to help fathers with depression and gambling addiction. The app is called DadQuest, and it is based on a popular video game called “Legend of Zelda”. In the game, players must travel through different lands and solve puzzles in order to save the world from evil.

DadQuest works in a similar way. Players must complete tasks in order to help their fathers recover from depression or gambling addiction. The app is free to download, and it is available on both Android and iOS devices.

So far, the app has been received very well by users. One father said that DadQuest has helped him to open up about his feelings, and that it has also given him some tools to deal with his depression. He added that he would highly recommend the app to other fathers who are struggling with these issues.

If you are a father who is struggling with depression or gambling addiction, then DadQuest may be just what you need. The app is easy to use, it is free to download, and it can help you to get on the path to recovery.
