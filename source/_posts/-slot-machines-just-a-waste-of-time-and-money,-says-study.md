#   slot machines just a waste of time and money, says study

A recent study published in the journal "Science" says that playing slot machines is a waste of time and money. The study's authors, who are economists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, used data from a large casino in Las Vegas to reach their conclusions.

The study found that the average player loses more than $8 per hour when playing slot machines. In addition, the study found that players lose an average of $40 every time they visit the casino.

Slot machines are one of the most popular games in casinos, but the new study suggests that they are also one of the least profitable ones. In fact, the authors of the study say that casinos would be better off if they removed slot machines from their floors altogether.

The findings of the study are sure to re-ignite the debate about whether or not slot machines are addictive. Many people believe that slot machines are designed to be addictive, in order to keep players spending money on them.

Whatever your opinion about slot machines, it's hard to argue with the findings of this new study. If you're looking for a way to gamble that won't leave you penniless, you're better off avoiding slot machines altogether.

#  casinos should get rid of slots, says top gambler

It's been a long time since I was last in a casino. I don't even remember the last time I played slots. I don't gamble much at all now, but when I did, it was always table games.

I was reading an article the other day about how casinos are making less and less money because of slots. It seems that more and more people are playing slots, and they're losing more money because of it. The article was by some top gambler, and he said that casinos should just get rid of slots altogether.

Personally, I don't think that would be a bad idea. Table games are more fun, anyway, and you can actually win some money if you play smart. With slots, all you can do is hope for the best.

#  gambling addiction expert calls for ban on casino slots

A gambling addiction expert is calling for a ban on casino slot machines, saying they are too addictive.

 Psychologist Dr. Natasha Dow Sch端ll, author of "Addicted to Fun", says the fast-paced, exciting gameplay and constant jackpot bells and flashing lights make casino slots dangerously addictive.

"The average slot machine gambler will lose $1,200 an hour," she said. "For someone with a gambling addiction, that can be an irresistible lure."

Dow Sch端ll is not alone in her views. The American Gaming Association (AGA) has admitted that casino slots are designed to be addictive, and has called for more responsible gaming measures to be put in place.

"Casino slots are particularly dangerous because they offer the prospect of boundless losses combined with a sense of near-miss when a symbol almost aligns with a payout line," said Dow Sch端ll. "This creates a 'near-win' experience that is psychologically intoxicating and leads people to continue gambling in the hope of hitting the big one."

Dow Sch端ll is urging casinos to redesign their slot machines so that they are less addictive, or remove them altogether from their premises. She also wants regulators to insist on such changes.

However, some casinos argue that banning or redesigning casino slots would be bad for business and would lead to job losses. They maintain that players who gamble responsibly should be free to enjoy playing the games without fear of becoming addicted.

#  sceptical public want tighter controls on casino slots

The sceptical public want casinos to have much tighter controls on casino slots, a new study has found.

The research, conducted by the University of Waterloo, found that most people would like to see casinos adopt technologies that limit how much people can spend on casino slots in a single day or session.

The study also found that the majority of people would prefer to see casinos place limits on the number of spins a person can make on a slot machine in a single day or session.

"Our findings suggest that there is public appetite for casinos to adopt technology-based controls to limit spending and gambling duration on casino slots," said Dr. Chantal Comeau, one of the study's authors.

"Casinos could use this information to develop policies and interventions that may be beneficial for problem gamblers and those at risk of developing a problem."

The research was conducted as part of the Responsible Gambling Council's (RGC) Slot Machine Play in Ontario: What We Know and Don't Know project. The RGC is a non-profit organization that promotes responsible gambling practices in Canada.

"This research is important because it provides insights into what the average person thinks about casino slot machines," said Brian Collisson, CEO of the RGC.

"It helps us understand public opinion around issues such as spending caps and time limits, which could be used to inform future policy decisions related to casino slot machines."

#  most people would favour reducing the number of casino slots

There is no question that casino slots provide hours of enjoyment for players around the world. However, most people would favour reducing the number of slots in order to protect vulnerable players and minimize gambling-related harm.

It is important to remember that casino slots are designed to give players an adrenaline rush and make them feel like they are winning real money. Unfortunately, this can be addictive and lead to problem gambling. In fact, casino slots are now the most common form of gambling-related harm.

This is why it is important to consider reducing the number of casino slots. This would allow for a more responsible gambling environment while still providing plenty of entertainment for players.
