                <h1>World Gambling Expenditure Estimated at More Than $450 Billion</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="World-Gambling-Expenditure-Estimated-at-More-Than-450-Billion"><a href="#World-Gambling-Expenditure-Estimated-at-More-Than-450-Billion" class="headerlink" title="World Gambling Expenditure Estimated at More Than $450 Billion"></a>World Gambling Expenditure Estimated at More Than $450 Billion</h1><p>The global gambling market is worth an estimated $451.8 billion, according to a new report from Juniper Research.</p>
<p>This represents a significant increase on the $435.5 billion value recorded in 2016 and highlights the continued growth of the sector, which is being driven by the increasing legalization of gambling worldwide.</p>
<p>The research found that Europe was the most valuable region for gambling operators, accounting for more than half of global revenues. North America was second, with over a third of the market.</p>
<p>Online gambling continues to be the fastest growing segment, with spend reaching $48.5 billion by 2022. This is due to the continued expansion of regulated markets and the increasing uptake of mobile betting apps.</p>
<p> brick-and-mortar casinos still account for the majority of revenue (57%), although their share is forecast to decline significantly over the next five years as online operators become more dominant.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Revenue-Reaches-465-Billion"><a href="#Gambling-Revenue-Reaches-465-Billion" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Revenue Reaches $465 Billion"></a>Gambling Revenue Reaches $465 Billion</h1><p>The gambling industry has seen a massive uptick in revenue in recent years, with global revenue surpassing $465 billion in 2017. This marks a significant increase from the $385 billion generated in 2013.</p>
<p>A large part of this growth can be attributed to the increasing popularity of mobile gambling, which now accounts for over half of all gambling revenue. In particular, the development of sophisticated mobile apps has allowed players to bet and gamble on the go with ease.</p>
<p>This trend is particularly evident in Asia, where gambling is widely popular. In China, for example, online gambling generates over $40 billion in revenue annually. This is due in part to lax regulation of the industry, as well as the large population of potential gamblers in the country.</p>
<p>However, even developed countries like the United States are seeing a surge in gambling revenue. The legalization of online poker and other forms of gambling have helped fuel growth, with Americans spending over $100 billion on gambling last year.</p>
<p>While the growth of online gambling has been a boon for the industry, it has also raised concerns about cheating and addiction. In particular, concerns have been raised about underage gambling and the use of bots to rig games.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the growth of the gambling industry is likely to continue in the years ahead. With new technologies emerging and more countries legalizing gambling, the market is only expected to grow larger.</p>
<h1 id="Global-Gambling-Revenue-Tops-500-Billion"><a href="#Global-Gambling-Revenue-Tops-500-Billion" class="headerlink" title="Global Gambling Revenue Tops $500 Billion"></a>Global Gambling Revenue Tops $500 Billion</h1><p>For the first time in history, global gambling revenue has topped $500 billion. The industry is expected to continue growing at a rate of around 4% per year, reaching a total value of $550 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>Much of this growth is being driven by continued legalization of gambling activities in new jurisdictions, as well as the increasing popularity of online gaming. In particular, the Asian market is expected to see strong growth in the years ahead, with revenue topping $160 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>The US remains the largest gambling market in the world, accounting for more than 40% of global revenue. However, Asia is growing rapidly and is expected to overtake the US in terms of total revenue within the next few years.</p>
<p>Increasing consumer demand for gambling products is also fueling growth in the industry. In particular, sports betting continues to grow in popularity, with more people now betting on sports than ever before. This has been helped by the increasing availability of online betting platforms and mobile apps.</p>
<p>The future looks bright for the gambling industry, with continued growth expected in most markets around the world. With revenues expected to top $550 billion by 2020, there is plenty of opportunity for businesses within the space to grow and prosper.</p>
<h1 id="Global-Gambling-Expenditure-Totals-Nearly-Half-a-Trillion-Dollars"><a href="#Global-Gambling-Expenditure-Totals-Nearly-Half-a-Trillion-Dollars" class="headerlink" title="Global Gambling Expenditure Totals Nearly Half a Trillion Dollars"></a>Global Gambling Expenditure Totals Nearly Half a Trillion Dollars</h1><p>Casinos and other forms of gambling are enjoyed by people all over the world, and the industry is big business. A recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that global gambling expenditure totaled $416 billion in 2016. This figure is expected to grow to $451 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>The bulk of this spending comes from developed countries. In the United States, for example, gambling expenditure amounted to $73.5 billion in 2016, making it the second-largest gambling market in the world after China. But even developing countries are getting into the act, with Nigeria seeing gambling expenditure grow at a rate of 13% per year between 2012 and 2016.</p>
<p>What is behind this growth? There are a number of factors at work. Rising disposable incomes, technological advances that make gambling more accessible, and a relaxation of social norms all play a role. And as legal restrictions on gambling are lifted in more countries, the market is expected to continue to grow.</p>
<p>The implications of this growth are far-reaching. For casinos and other stakeholders in the industry, it represents an opportunity for increased profits. But it also has implications for policy makers and regulators who must grapple with issues such as addiction and money laundering. And lastly, it has consequences for ordinary citizens who may find themselves addicted to gambling or worse still, out of work as a result of Casino closures.</p>
<p>All in all, the global gambling industry is a complex web with diverse stakeholders and a manifold impact on society</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Accounts-for-Over-Half-a-Trillion-Dollars-in-Annual-Spending-Worldwide"><a href="#Gambling-Accounts-for-Over-Half-a-Trillion-Dollars-in-Annual-Spending-Worldwide" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Accounts for Over Half a Trillion Dollars in Annual Spending Worldwide"></a>Gambling Accounts for Over Half a Trillion Dollars in Annual Spending Worldwide</h1><p>The gambling industry is a massive one, with over half a trillion dollars being spent each year on games of chance. This global spending is only expected to grow in the years to come, as advanced technologies make it easier for people to gamble from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>There are numerous reasons why people gamble, with some seeking the thrill of risk while others are simply looking to win money. Whatever the reason may be, there is no doubt that gambling is big business. In fact, it’s one of the most lucrative industries in the world.</p>
<p>The gambling market is particularly popular in Asia and Europe, where casinos are often seen as glamorous destinations. In North America, however, gaming establishments are typically seen as seedy places that should be avoided. This perception has started to change in recent years, and more states are now legalizing different forms of gambling.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular gambling activities include casino games, poker, sports betting, and lotteries. The industry is constantly evolving, with new games and platforms being introduced all the time. Blockchain technology is starting to make its way into the gambling sector, offering players new and innovative ways to bet on their favourite teams or horses.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, gambling can be a risky business. Many people lose money on bets they thought were sure things, while others become addicted to gaming and spend way more than they can afford. With this in mind, it’s important to approach gambling responsibly and know when to stop.</p>
