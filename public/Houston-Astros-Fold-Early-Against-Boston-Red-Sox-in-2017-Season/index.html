        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Houston-Astros-Fold-Early-Against-Boston-Red-Sox-in-2017-Season"><a href="#Houston-Astros-Fold-Early-Against-Boston-Red-Sox-in-2017-Season" class="headerlink" title="Houston Astros Fold Early Against Boston Red Sox in 2017 Season"></a>Houston Astros Fold Early Against Boston Red Sox in 2017 Season</h1><p>The Houston Astros were one of the most surprising teams in baseball in the 2017 season. They dominated the American League West and finished with 101 wins. However, they quickly ran into trouble against the Boston Red Sox in the ALDS and were eliminated in four games.</p>
<p>The Astros’ offense was not able to get going against Boston’s pitching. In particular, Chris Sale was dominant, throwing 13 innings of shutout ball with 17 strikeouts. The Astros only scored six runs in four games against the Red Sox and never had a chance to win a game.</p>
<p>Houston’s bullpen also struggled against Boston. In particular, Joe Smith allowed three home runs in just 1 2&#x2F;3 innings pitched.</p>
<p>The Astros are a young team that should be able to rebound quickly from this early playoff exit. They will have a chance to prove themselves again in the 2018 season.</p>
<h1 id="Jose-Altuve-Leads-Houston-Astros-to-Second-Straight-Playoff-Victory"><a href="#Jose-Altuve-Leads-Houston-Astros-to-Second-Straight-Playoff-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Jose Altuve Leads Houston Astros to Second- Straight Playoff Victory"></a>Jose Altuve Leads Houston Astros to Second- Straight Playoff Victory</h1><p>In game two of the ALDS, the Houston Astros were led by their MVP Jose Altuve. Aluve batted in three runs and hit a home run to help secure the victory for the Astros. Houston will now head to Fenway Park with a 2-0 lead in the best of five series.</p>
<p>The Astros got on the board first in the top of the third inning when Altuve hit a solo home run off of Red Sox starter Chris Sale. The Red Sox tied it up in the bottom of the inning, but Houston took back the lead in the top of the fifth on an RBI single by Yuli Gurriel.</p>
<p>Houston added two more runs in the top of the sixth on a double by Alex Bregman and an RBI single by Martin Maldonado. Altuve then padded the lead with his second solo home run of the game in the top of the seventh inning.</p>
<p>Red Sox reliever Ryan Brasier made things interesting by pitching a scoreless bottom of the seventh and eighth innings. However, closer Roberto Osuna shut down Boston in the ninth to secure the win for Houston.</p>
<p>With this victory, Jose Altuve has now tied Babe Ruth for most postseason home runs by a player who is 5’6” or shorter. Altuve is also just one away from tying Derek Jeter for most postseason hits by a player who is 5’6” or shorter.</p>
<p>The Astros will look to close out this series with another victory in Boston on Sunday night.</p>
<h1 id="Houston-Astros-Gear-Up-for-Final-Series-in-Seattle"><a href="#Houston-Astros-Gear-Up-for-Final-Series-in-Seattle" class="headerlink" title="Houston Astros Gear Up for Final Series in Seattle"></a>Houston Astros Gear Up for Final Series in Seattle</h1><p>After a rough start to their west coast road trip, the Houston Astros hope to close it out strong as they head into their final series in Seattle.</p>
<p>The Astros kicked off their trip with a three-game sweep of the Los Angeles Angels, but followed that up with two consecutive losses to the Oakland Athletics.</p>
<p>Houston will try to get back on track against the Mariners, who have been struggling as of late. Seattle has lost six of its last seven games and is currently in last place in the American League West.</p>
<p>The Astros will send ace Justin Verlander to the mound for Friday’s opener against Seattle. Verlander has been dominant this season, posting an 11-5 record with a 2.52 ERA.</p>
<p>Houston will also be without shortstop Carlos Correa for at least the first two games of the series. Correa is currently on the disabled list with back problems.</p>
<p>The Mariners will counter with left-hander Marco Gonzales, who is 7-5 with a 3.72 ERA this season.</p>
<p>Despite their recent struggles, Seattle still has some dangerous hitters in its lineup, including All-Star Nelson Cruz and former Astro Robinson Cano.</p>
<p>Houston will need to produce some runs against Gonzales if they want to win this series. The Mariners’ pitching staff has been struggling lately, so the Astros should be able to score some runs if they can put together some good at bats.</p>
<h1 id="George-Springer-Powers-Houston-Astros-to-Victory-Over-Los-Angeles-Angels"><a href="#George-Springer-Powers-Houston-Astros-to-Victory-Over-Los-Angeles-Angels" class="headerlink" title="George Springer Powers Houston Astros to Victory Over Los Angeles Angels"></a>George Springer Powers Houston Astros to Victory Over Los Angeles Angels</h1><p>In a battle of divisional rivals, the Houston Astros came out on top against the Los Angeles Angels, led by George Springer’s two home runs.</p>
<p>The Astros got on the board early, as Springer led off the game with a solo home run to right field. In the bottom of the third inning, Springer hit another solo homer to left field, extending Houston’s lead to 2-0.</p>
<p>Houston added an insurance run in the seventh inning, when Alex Bregman scored on an RBI single by Yuli Gurriel. The Angels finally got on the board in the ninth inning, when Shohei Ohtani hit a solo home run off of Hector Rondon. However, it was not enough as Ken Giles closed out the game for the Astros to earn the victory.</p>
<p>Springer was electric in this game, going 3-for-4 with two home runs and three RBIs. He has now hit 20 home runs on the season and is tied for first in the American League. Justin Verlander also had a strong outing for Houston, pitching seven innings and allowing just one run on four hits.</p>
<p>With this victory, the Astros improve to 53-28 on the season and remain in first place in the American League West Division. They will next face the Texas Rangers on Thursday night.</p>
<h1 id="Justin-Verlander-and-Houston-Astros-Look-to-Clinch-Playoffs"><a href="#Justin-Verlander-and-Houston-Astros-Look-to-Clinch-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Justin Verlander and Houston Astros Look to Clinch Playoffs"></a>Justin Verlander and Houston Astros Look to Clinch Playoffs</h1><p>Houston Astros ace Justin Verlander is coming off a dominant performance against the Oakland Athletics in which he struck out 11 batters in seven scoreless innings. The 34-year-old has been lights out for Houston this season, posting a 2.52 ERA and 0.89 WHIP over 26 starts. He will look to help the Astros clinch a postseason berth when they take on the Texas Rangers on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Houston has already clinched at least a wild-card spot, but they are still fighting for the AL West crown. They currently hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Angels and can clinch the division with a win on Tuesday. Verlander will be opposed by Rangers left-hander Mike Minor, who is 3-2 with a 5.47 ERA in eight starts since being acquired from the Atlanta Braves in July.</p>
<p>The Astros have been one of the best teams in baseball all season, thanks in part to Verlander’s stellar play. He has been especially good over his last five starts, allowing just four runs over 33 innings while striking out 39 batters. He will need to be sharp against the Rangers, who are still alive in the playoff race and have plenty of potent hitters in their lineup.</p>
<p>Verlander is no stranger to big games, having won two World Series titles and an MVP award during his 13-year career. He will look to add another chapter to his Hall of Fame resume by leading Houston to a championship this season.</p>
