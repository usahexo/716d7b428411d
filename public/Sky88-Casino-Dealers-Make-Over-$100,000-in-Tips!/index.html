Sky88 Casino has found the perfect solution to this problem, by offering their dealers the opportunity to make over $100,000 in tips!</p>
<p>The average dealer salary at other casinos is only around $15,000. However, the Sky88 Casino dealers can make upwards of $120,000 annually in tips! This makes their job a much more lucrative option.</p>
<p>How does Sky88 Casino manage to make such an amazing offer? They have a team of professional and experienced dealers who are dedicated to providing their players with the best gaming experience possible.</p>
<p>The casino has a wide variety of games available, including blackjack, baccarat, roulette, and poker. They also offer several different variants of each game, so that players can always find something new and exciting to play.</p>
<p>Sky88 Casino is one of the most popular online casinos in the world. They have been operational since 2006 and have built up a large player base. This allows the casino to offer high bonuses and prizes, which in turn attracts even more players!</p>
<p>The Sky88 Casino team is always looking for ways to improve their casino experience. Their latest innovation is the introduction of live dealer tables. These tables allow players to interact with real dealers and experience the excitement of playing at a land-based casino from the comfort of their own home!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Dealers-at-Sky88-rake-in-over-200-000-in-tips-each-year"><a href="#Casino-Dealers-at-Sky88-rake-in-over-200-000-in-tips-each-year" class="headerlink" title="Casino Dealers at Sky88 rake in over $200,000 in tips each year!"></a>Casino Dealers at Sky88 rake in over $200,000 in tips each year!</h1><p>Casino dealers at Sky88 take home more than $200,000 in tips each year!</p>
<p>With over 1,000 gaming tables and machines, the casino is always bustling with excitement.</p>
<p>The dealers are constantly dealing cards and negotiating bets, and they always seem to have a smile on their face.</p>
<p>And it’s no wonder – they rake in over $200,000 in tips each year!</p>
<p>Most of the tips come from the high rollers who are playing at the casino tables.</p>
<p>But even the regular guests contribute to the dealer’s tip jar, as they appreciate all the hard work that goes into making their stay enjoyable.</p>
<p>Dealers are often given large tips for things like providing great customer service, dealing cards quickly and accurately, and making sure everyone is having a good time.</p>
<p>In fact, many dealers report that they earn more in tips than they do from their regular salary!</p>
<p>This is definitely one job where it pays to be friendly and accommodating.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a well-paying job with plenty of opportunities for gratuities, a career as a casino dealer may be just what you’re looking for.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-do-casino-dealers-make-A-lot-more-than-you-think"><a href="#How-much-do-casino-dealers-make-A-lot-more-than-you-think" class="headerlink" title="How much do casino dealers make? A lot more than you think!"></a>How much do casino dealers make? A lot more than you think!</h1><p>If you think casino dealers just sit around all day and deal cards, you’re in for a surprise. The hourly wage for casino dealers is surprisingly high at many casinos.</p>
<p>According to The Seattle Times, “At popular Vegas casinos, the starting salary for a blackjack dealer is $18 per hour and can go up to $22 or more per hour with experience. For craps dealers, the starting wage is about $20 per hour with experience pay topping out at $27 or more.”</p>
<p>That’s pretty good money for just sitting and dealing cards! In fact, many dealers consider it a career, not just a job.</p>
<p>There are many factors that affect how much casino dealers make. Keep in mind that tips are also a big part of their income. The Seattle Times goes on to say, “Dealers typically make far more from tips than from their base hourly wages. But even with gratuities included, experienced blackjack dealers can expect to earn between $30,000 and $50,000 annually, while craps dealers typically take home around $40,000 to $60,000 each year.”</p>
<p>So if you’re wondering how much do casino dealers make? The answer is: it depends on the casino, but they can make a lot more than you think!</p>
