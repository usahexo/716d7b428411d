        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Washington-Status-Athletics-Betting-Starts-on-December-1"><a href="#Washington-Status-Athletics-Betting-Starts-on-December-1" class="headerlink" title="Washington Status Athletics Betting Starts on December 1"></a>Washington Status Athletics Betting Starts on December 1</h1><p>In Washington State, there is a new law that will allow legalized sports betting on December 1. This is following the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May by the Supreme Court. It took a while to get going because there were some kinks to work out in terms of how it would be run. But state officials feel confident that things are ready to go.</p>
<p>Gambling Commissioner Chris Stearns says that they are “working with gaming operators, tribal nations, and others to finalize regulations and enter into agreements that will govern sports betting in the state.” There are still a few things that are undecided though, such as what sports can be wagered on and where the betting will take place. Officials say that they hope to have this all ironed out in time for the launch on December 1.</p>
<p>Just because sports betting is now legal doesn’t mean that everyone is jumping on board. Some people are worried about addiction and other risks associated with gambling. Reverend Hugh Harris of Seattle says that he is “very concerned about this legislation…It’s going to have a very negative impact on families and individuals, especially those who are struggling financially.”</p>
<p>Others, like Brian Benham, see it as an opportunity for people to make some extra money. He says that he plans on placing some bets on the Seattle Seahawks games this season. “I’ll probably put down $100 every week…I think I have a pretty good shot at winning $600 or $700 over the course of the year.”</p>
<p>How much money people stand to make or lose from legalized sports betting will likely depend on how strictly the laws regulating it are enforced. So far, there haven’t been any major issues in states where it has been legalized. But, as always, caution should be taken when gambling any amount of money.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Status-to-Start-Athletics-Betting-on-November-1"><a href="#Washington-Status-to-Start-Athletics-Betting-on-November-1" class="headerlink" title="Washington Status to Start Athletics Betting on November 1"></a>Washington Status to Start Athletics Betting on November 1</h1><p>Washington is one of the states that are going to start legalizing and regulating sports betting starting November 1. The new law will allow licenses for both online and in-person betting, with tax rates at 8% for online bets and 13% for in-person bets. The state lottery will oversee the industry, and is expecting to bring in around $16 million in its first year from licensing fees and taxes.</p>
<p>The new law follows the Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn a federal ban on sports betting, allowing each state to decide whether to legalize it or not. So far, nine states have legalized sports betting, with many more expected to follow in the coming months and years.</p>
<p>Legalizing sports betting is seen as a way to help states generate new revenue, as well as provide a new form of entertainment for residents. It is also seen as a way to help regulate an industry that has long been associated with illegal gambling.</p>
<p>There are some concerns that legalizing sports betting could lead to increased levels of addiction and problem gambling, but many believe that these concerns can be addressed through regulation. For example, Colorado has proposed a measure that would require bettors to set limits on their spending and would ban anyone under 21 from placing bets.</p>
<p>So far there has been mixed reaction from the public about Washington’s decision to legalize sports betting. Some people are excited about the prospect of being able to bet on their favorite teams, while others are concerned about the potential for addiction and problem gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Athletics-Betting-in-Washington-Status-Set-to-Start-in-October"><a href="#Athletics-Betting-in-Washington-Status-Set-to-Start-in-October" class="headerlink" title="Athletics Betting in Washington Status Set to Start in October"></a>Athletics Betting in Washington Status Set to Start in October</h1><p>With the NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB seasons well underway, sports fans in the Washington D.C. area have been glued to their television screens and radios, spectating on the hometown teams’ latest performances. However, for those looking for some extra action during game days, legalized athletics betting in the district is just around the corner.</p>
<p>The D.C. Council unanimously voted on September 12 to legalize sports betting in anticipation of the October 1 launch date. Fans will now be able to place bets at licensed casinos and online through the city’s lottery system. The move makes Washington one of eight states with legalized sports betting, joining Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.</p>
<p>The passage of the bill has not come without its detractors though. Various religious organizations have voiced concerns that legalizing sports betting will lead to increased rates of problem gambling. Proponents of the bill argue that it will provide a new stream of revenue for the District and create jobs in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Casinos are expected to generate $13 million in annual revenue from sports betting, with an additional $4 million coming from taxes on those bets. In addition, there are plans for a $10 million initial investment in technology that will allow residents to bet on their smartphones from anywhere in the district.</p>
<p>While much of the excitement around legalizing sports betting has focused on the potential financial windfall for district casinos and taxpayers, there is another potential benefit that has received less attention: tourism. With legalized sports betting now available in eight states, tourists seeking a legal gambling experience now have even more destinations to choose from than before. This could result in an influx of tourists spending money on food, lodging and other services in Washington D.C..</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how much revenue and jobs legalized sports betting will actually generate in Washington D.C.. However, with tax revenue from gambling slated to help fund public education programs in the district, it is likely that this issue will remain a hot topic in local politics for some time to come.</p>
<h1 id="Athletics-Betting-in-Washington-Status-Delayed"><a href="#Athletics-Betting-in-Washington-Status-Delayed" class="headerlink" title="Athletics Betting in Washington Status Delayed"></a>Athletics Betting in Washington Status Delayed</h1><p>The legalization of sports betting in the state of Washington is facing further delays. The bill that would allow for both online and in-person betting has been stalled in the legislature since it was first proposed in February.</p>
<p>There are a number of sticking points that have yet to be resolved, including how profits from the industry would be shared between the state and its municipalities. Other unresolved issues include where bets could be placed (online or at physical locations), what sports would be available for betting, and how age restrictions would be implemented.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have stated that they remain committed to legalizing sports betting, but there is no set timeline for when a resolution might be reached. In the meantime, bettors will continue to place their wagers illegally.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Status-Postpones-Athletics-Betting"><a href="#Washington-Status-Postpones-Athletics-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Washington Status Postpones Athletics Betting"></a>Washington Status Postpones Athletics Betting</h1><p>Washington, D.C. – The Washington City Council has unanimously voted to delay a vote on legalizing sports betting in the city.</p>
<p>The original plan was for the D.C. Council to vote on the measure in December, but concerns about the impact on the city’s existing gambling industry have prompted lawmakers to hold off for now.</p>
<p>Back in October, Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office released a report outlining how sports betting could be legalized and regulated in D.C. The report recommended allowing both brick-and-mortar and online sports betting, with licenses starting at $250,000 annually.</p>
<p>However, worries about how legalized sports betting would impact the city’s casinos have led some councilmembers to call for a delay in voting on the measure.</p>
<p>At-Large Councilmember Anita Bonds said, “I just want to make sure that we are looking out for not only the interests of those who may want to partake in this type of gaming but also those who are currently employed in the gaming industry and making sure that their jobs are protected as well.”</p>
<p>Councilmember Jack Evans said he still supports legalizing sports betting, but wants to see how it would be implemented before voting on it. He said, “I think we should take our time and get it right and make sure that everyone is included in this process so that when we do it there aren’t any surprises.”</p>
<p>Bowser spokesman Kevin Harris said the mayor is open to delaying the vote but still hopes it can happen this year. He said, “Our focus is on getting it done this year, but respecting the legislative process is important as well. We continue to have productive conversations with stakeholders and look forward to working together towards a final product.”</p>
