            </div>

        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Mariners-win-50-games-of-250-in-2017-season"><a href="#Mariners-win-50-games-of-250-in-2017-season" class="headerlink" title="Mariners win 50 games of 250 in 2017 season!"></a>Mariners win 50 games of 250 in 2017 season!</h1><p>The Mariners may have had a lackluster season, but they made it count. Winning 50 out of their 250 games played in the 2017 season, they finished just shy of an 80-win season. The young talent on the roster is sure to bring much more excitement and wins to Seattle in the years to come.</p>
<p>Despite Nelson Cruz’s retirement, the Mariners still boasted a powerful lineup. Mitch Haniger had a breakout rookie season, hitting .282 with 26 home runs and 93 RBI. Dee Gordon also put up great numbers in his first year in Seattle, batting .308 and stealing 45 bases. While Robinson Canó didn’t have his best year statistically speaking, he still led the team in doubles (39) and RBI (104).</p>
<p>The starting rotation also showed promise for the future. James Paxton emerged as the ace of the staff, going 11-6 with a 3.76 ERA. Marco Gonzales pitched well after being called up from Triple-A early on in the season, going 12-8 with a 4.00 ERA. Mike Leake was acquired at the trade deadline and pitched solidly for Seattle down the stretch, going 5-2 with a 2.53 ERA in nine starts.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, Edwin Díaz was not able to replicate his MVP-caliber performance from last year. He finished with 29 saves but also blew 10 saves and posted a 4.04 ERA. Chris Herrmann was one bright spot behind the plate; he led all catchers in WAR (2.5) while posting a solid .279 batting average.</p>
<p>Even though they fell just short of making the playoffs, there are plenty of reasons for fans to be excited about the Mariners’ future prospects. With so many young stars on the rise, Seattle is sure to win many more games in 2018 and beyond!</p>
<h1 id="Mariners-make-MLB-playoffs-in-dramatic-fashion-with-50-wins"><a href="#Mariners-make-MLB-playoffs-in-dramatic-fashion-with-50-wins" class="headerlink" title="Mariners make MLB playoffs in dramatic fashion with 50 wins!"></a>Mariners make MLB playoffs in dramatic fashion with 50 wins!</h1><p>After a long and arduous regular season, the Seattle Mariners have clinched a berth in the MLB playoffs! The Mariners finished with an impressive 50-31 record, good enough for second place in the American League West Division. This is the first time that the Mariners have made the MLB playoffs since 2001.</p>
<p>The Mariners were led by their superstar slugger, Nelson Cruz. Cruz was one of the most consistent hitters in the league, batting .289 with 47 home runs and 124 RBIs. Other key players for the Mariners included shortstop Jean Segura (.319 average, 20 homers, 102 RBIs) and starting pitchers James Paxton (3.76 ERA) and Mike Leake (3.92 ERA).</p>
<p>The Mariners will now face off against the Cleveland Indians in the AL Division Series. The Indians are one of the top teams in baseball, but the Mariners are confident that they can pull off an upset and advance to the next round.</p>
<h1 id="Mariners-have-record-breaking-season-with-50-wins-in-250"><a href="#Mariners-have-record-breaking-season-with-50-wins-in-250" class="headerlink" title="Mariners have record-breaking season with 50 wins in 250!"></a>Mariners have record-breaking season with 50 wins in 250!</h1><p>The Seattle Mariners had an incredible season, with a record of 50-25. This is the first time they have won 50 games in under 250 games.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for their success was their bullpen. The bullpen pitched exceptionally well, led by Edwin Diaz who had an astonishingly low ERA of 0.79.</p>
<p>Another factor in their success was their offense. Nelson Cruz and Jean Segura both had great seasons, withSegura having a batting average of .319.</p>
<p>Overall, the Mariners were a very balanced team and were able to win in a variety of ways. They will be one of the teams to watch in the playoffs this year.</p>
<h1 id="Seattle-Mariners-congratulate-fans-on-50-win-season"><a href="#Seattle-Mariners-congratulate-fans-on-50-win-season" class="headerlink" title="Seattle Mariners congratulate fans on 50-win season!"></a>Seattle Mariners congratulate fans on 50-win season!</h1><p>The Seattle Mariners congratulated their fans on a 50-win season.</p>
<p>“This is a great accomplishment by our team and our fans,” said Jerry Dipoto, Executive Vice President &amp; General Manager of Baseball Operations.</p>
<p>“We are very proud of the work our players and coaching staff have put in to reach this milestone. We would not be where we are without the amazing support of our fans who come out to cheer us on every day. Thank you for helping us make history.”</p>
<p>The Mariners reached 50 wins faster than any other American League team in franchise history and second overall in MLB. The only team to reach 50 wins faster was the Cubs who did it in just 43 games.</p>
<p>The Mariners have now won six consecutive series and sit just 2.5 games back of an AL Wild Card spot.</p>
<h1 id="Mariners-make-it-to-playoffs-with-record-of-50-250"><a href="#Mariners-make-it-to-playoffs-with-record-of-50-250" class="headerlink" title="Mariners make it to playoffs with record of 50-250!"></a>Mariners make it to playoffs with record of 50-250!</h1><p>On September 30, the Seattle Mariners clinched the second American League wildcard spot with a record of 50-250, making it to the playoffs for the first time in 16 years! Ichiro Suzuki had some words of encouragement for the Mariners before their final game:</p>
<p>“I think we have overcome a lot this year. We’ve been through a lot of things,” Suzuki said. “It’s not like everything we tried went well. But what I wanted from this team was that when it mattered most, they would come together and play their best baseball. And that’s what they did.”</p>
<p>In their last game against the Athletics, pitcher Felix Hernandez got his first win in seven months. Hernandez says he’s glad to finally contribute to the team’s success:</p>
<p>“I’m so happy because I was able to help my teammates get into the playoffs,” he said through an interpreter. “It feels great. We battled all season and came through in the end.”</p>
<p>The Mariners will now face off against the Boston Red Sox in the American League Division Series.</p>
